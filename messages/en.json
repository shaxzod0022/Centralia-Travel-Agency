    "description2": "Like every great adventure, we started small, with a close-knit group of young, enthusiastic hikers who loved nothing more than spending our days in nature. While I’m usually the first person you’ll hear from – replying to your emails or chatting with you on a video call to help pick the perfect trail – I’m really just the starting point. Behind me is a whole team of hikers, travel advisors, and route planners who live and breathe the trails we send you on.",
    "title3": "From Local Trails to Worldwide Adventures",
    "description3": "Based in Slovenia, where the Julian Alps begin just beyond our doorstep, it felt only natural to start sharing the beauty of our homeland—and eventually, the world—with others. What started as a small initiative has grown into something far bigger. As more and more travellers joined our hikes, our team expanded too, bringing in destination experts, trail planners, route designers, and a behind-the-scenes support team.Step by step, our hiking portfolio grew beyond Slovenia, across Europe, and eventually to the most scenic trails in Asia and the Americas. With so many epic journeys under our belt, it became clear that we needed one united identity to bring it all together.",
